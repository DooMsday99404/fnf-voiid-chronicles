This is the latest version of Voiid Chronicles, and it is designed to work only on Windows.

I have spent a lot of time and effort uploading this because the file size exceeds 100MB.

Since GitHub has limits on large files, I had to use Git LFS to make this available.

This version includes all the latest updates, improvements, and bug fixes.

If you're a fan of the game, make sure to download it and check out the new features.

I appreciate all the support, and I hope you enjoy playing Voiid Chronicles.

Please let me know if you run into any issues or need help with installation.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed for the game to run smoothly.

If you like the game, consider sharing it with others who might enjoy it.

Thanks for downloading, and have fun playing! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®
